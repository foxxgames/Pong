# Pong
A simple Pong clone.
Make sure to unzip the DLL file and place the .dll files in the same directory as the .exe.
The source code is in the source folder.
To build Pong yourself you need the SDL library which is found here https://github.com/libsdl-org.
In addition you need the SDL_ttf and SDL_mixer libraries which are also found on SDL Github.
A tutorial can be found here https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php.
In the Makefile specify where the Include and Library directories are for SDL.
